# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

I was assigned a project to make a PreworkStudy Guide webpage for the coding bootcamp. I built this page to help future bootcamp students to be able to study the topics covered in the Prework modules. It covers all of the topics needed to create this webpage, HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I learned how much actually goes into building webpages and how there will often be a need for debugging.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section in this webpage contains notes about the main topics we covered in the modules which are HTML, Css, Git, and JavaScript.  These notes can be used to study for the Bootcamp, and be used as a reference for each of the languages. We can also see the JavaScript running if we open the Dev Tools console.
